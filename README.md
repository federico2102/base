# Multiplayer Card Game

## Description

This multiplayer card game is a web-based application that allows users to create and join game sessions with friends or random players. Built using React for the frontend and Socket.IO for real-time communication, the game features a simple and intuitive interface that enables players to manage their hands, interact with each other, and keep track of game state.

### Features:
- **Create and Join Games**: Players can create new game sessions or join existing ones using a session code.
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Utilize WebSocket connections to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay with updates reflecting in real time.
- **Player Management**: Players can be added or removed dynamically, and the game notifies players of changes in the session.
